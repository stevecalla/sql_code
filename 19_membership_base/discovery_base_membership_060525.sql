--    ------------------------------------
--    For each year in the selected range, this query calculates:
--      - Unique count of members based on `id_profiles`
--      - Unique count based on `member_number_members_sa`
--    It joins the `sales_key_stats_2015` table using membership validity
--    windows (start and end years), providing a high-level trend of
--    membership reach per year.

--    This CTE-based query:

--      - Calculates total memberships per profile per year
--      - Ranks memberships by type priority (adult_annual > youth > one_day > elite > other)
--      - Selects the best-ranked membership per profile per year
--    The final output groups by year, membership type, and new member category,
--    showing how many unique profiles had that best membership and the total count
--    of all their memberships that year.

--    Similar to Query 2, but:

--        if the membership started in the target year
--      - For all other types, includes them only if valid on 12/31 of the target year
--    This ensures that 'one_day' memberships are not overcounted across years,
--    and that long-term memberships are evaluated based on year-end status.
