Is there logic that determines the current membership base? Meaning the current members defined as active? This would be different than sales. Sales is a leading indicator of how membership base will change over time but not the same. For example, if I was going to create a membership base definition, I would start with:

Look at all valid members and membership periods

Active Rule #1: Any member with a membership period in which the start date is <= today and the end date is > than today (for the calendar date under consideration)

Active Rule #2: Might be a rule that considers any one-day purchased in the last year or 6 months or 3 months active (without double counting or otherwise)

Other Rules: Other rules based on nuances in the data (maybe for Lifetime or other)

I would create SQL that determined a members status on any given calendar date by comparing/evaluating that members membership periods against the calendar date in question then sum it all up by calendar date.

Hi Steve,

When asked to pull our active member list, we follow rule 1 with end => than today. This would exclude people who have purchased a one-day for future event.

When asked for a list of active members this month we would set rules of start date <= end of month and end date >= start of month.

When asked for unique members in a year we would set start date <= 12/31 and end date >= 1/1 and then dedup the list on member #.
